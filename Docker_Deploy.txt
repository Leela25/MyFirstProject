Deploying angular application using GIT, Jenkins and Docker
---------------------

What is Angular?
- It's a framework which is used to develop SPA(single page applications)
- Content will change based on user interaction

- Docker containers are alternative to VM's which are very lightweight
they contain the all the dependencies which are required for application but without the actual OS


angular application dependencies:
--------------------------
node.js - backend for your angular application
node package manager(npm) - install angular application and maintain all it's dependencies
package.json(meta data) - what dependencies we need it and version details etc present in this file


Sample Docker File
------------------
FROM node:6
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package.json /usr/src/app
RUN npm cache clean
RUN npm install
COPY . /usr/src/ap
EXPOSE 4200
CMD ["npm","start"]
