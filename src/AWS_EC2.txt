EC2(Elastic Cloud Computing)
----------------------------
Instances:
----------
- Instances  : On Demand(By Default AWS chooses instances type)
- Launch Templates : Here you can keep a template of all the configurations like instance type, volume, SG, VPC, Subnet etc..
- Spot Requests  : It's good for Testing/DEV activities, not for PROD. 
- Reserved Instances : You can reserve instance today itself for future purpose, the price is less if u reserve it advanced
- Dedicated Hosts : Complete host you can take it up, but the cost will be more

AMIs
----
- Suppose you installed multiple softwares and setup everything on one machine to run ur application, u can take image of this machine for Autoscaling purpose or duplicate the machines

EBS
----
Volumes - For each EC2 machine, the volumes are stored here, u can take backup of existing volume and attach to the another machine
also you can add extra volume to same machine also, it's almost simillar to connecting pendrive to your machine.
create new FS for this volume
