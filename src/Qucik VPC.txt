VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)
---------------------------
- Choose specific range of Private IP addresses for VPC
- you can create any number of subnets within ur VPC(but the subnet IP range shouldn't be beyond VPC range)

RT(Route Table)
---------------
- Create a RT and attach it to Subnet
- if you want to make subnet as public then specify the destination IP range as all(0.0.0.0/0) and attach ingetnet gateway, 
so if u attach this RT to any subnet, it can act as public subnet
- if you created private subnet, attach NAT gateway to the subnet
- make sure you have to create NAT gateway in public subnet

Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
--------------------------------
- Internet Gateway for Public subnet
- NAT(Network Address Transition) for Private subnet
- For NAT gateway, you have to attach Elastic IP

Private IP
----------
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


Address Range - 10.0.1.0/8 (10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255)
