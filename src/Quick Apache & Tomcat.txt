in default configuration file, we can see the directory root(/var/www/html)
- by default the index.html will be available under directory root
- all configuration files ends with *.conf and modules end with *mod
- if you want to enable any modules in apache which are not comes under default active modules list then,
a2enmod "modulename"
- Suppose to enable proxy module
a2enmod proxy

- After modifying any configurations in apache, in order to reflect the changes, make sure to restart the Apache
- Apache servers the static pages
- in configuration file, there will be virtual host block, where u need to enable/add server URL(typically DNS name)

Tomcat
------
- By Default tomcat listens on 8080
- To run tomcat,  java need to be install on the server
- Instead of insatllaing java from apt/yum repositories, it's better to download the java from offical website
- we have java 1.9, however there are some compatibility issues with tomcat and java1.9, so go for java 1.8
- install tomcat and java
- we need to set java and tomcat path, add bin folders of java and tomcat to PATH variable
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/jdk1.8/bin/:/usr/local/jdk1.8/jre/bin/:/usr/local/apache_tomcat/bin/
- Add this path variable to .bashrc file, which load the path whenever you login to the server
