Git:
   - It's a open source, cloud based Source Code Repository
   - Organizations prefer to set up repository in their premise
   - To install or setup git repository in any linux machine, first we need to install git-core
   - create a projtect nam elike "project.git" and run git init
   - Create a user with name "git" (useradd -m git)>
   - set password for git (passwd git)
   - From two different machines, create two more users(tom, jerry)
   - Add ssh keys of tom and jerry to git repository machine
   - we have to introduce ourself to git, before making any add/update/push/pull/commit

Working Copy, Local Repository, Remote Repository:
   - In git, every developer has his own local repository
   - Without having any internet connection, he can do any operations with local repository
   - To push it to the remote repository developer has to connect to internet
Commands:
  - git config --global user.name "git"
  - git config --global user.email "git@example.com"
  - git config --global editor vim
  - To list all git configurations, "git config --list"

From Tom and Jerry's machines:
  - First setup origin for ur code
    git remote add origin git@ipaddres:projtect.git
  - First add files to ur local repository and commit it
    git add filenames (and) git commit -m "put proper comment, so that other can understand"
  - Now push your code to remote repository
    git push origin master
  - If the code exist on Remote repository, first the developer has to clone the code
    git clone git@ipaddres:projtect.git
  
Commands:
 - To see all commits
  git log
  git show commitid
 - To go back to previous commit
  git reset --hard
  git reset --hard commitid

- To remove existing remote origin
  git remote rm origin
  
Branch Concepts:
  - To check list of branches
    git branch
  - To create new branch
    git branch Leela_Branch
    push ur branch to remote repository: git push branch Leela_Branch
  - mv and rm commands used for moving and removing files
  - To change one branch to another branch: git checkout Leela_Branch
  
Merging Concept:
  - To merge Leela_Branch changes to master (first u have to be on master)
    git merge Leela_Branch (if there are any merge conflicts it will show)
  - While merging u need to add comments
    
Tags:
  - For each release, there will be one tag created
  - It's always good to create tags based on release or based on module changes(for future reference)
  - Tag commands,
    git add tag Tagname, ex: git add tag Rlease1.0
    git tag list
    git push origin tag_name
    

Git Stash:

  - git stash : To save messy working copy in some location for future purpose
  - git stash apply : If you want to take the stash changes to your working copy
  - git stash list : It displays the multiple stashes
  - git stash save "message" : When u have multiple stashes, it's good to save with messages
  - git stash apply stash@{1} : it deletes the first stash
  - git stash drop stash@{1} : To drop the first stash
