IAM(AWS Identity and Access Management)
----------------------------
Users and Groups
-----------------
- It's simillar to UNIX users and groups concept
- While creating a user you have to sepcify the user need programatic access or AWS console access
- You can set up the password and add the user to existing group(if required)

Policies
----------
- There are some list of customized policies(while creating a user, u can attach required policies)
- Policies are documents that are stored using JSON
            "Action": "ec2:*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
- Suppose for some user, u selcted EC2ReadOnly policy, then that user can only view the EC2 he don't have right to create a new EC2
- You can create user defined Policies also

Roles
------
- You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your AWS resources
- Roles are required when one of your service want to call other service through API


- in IAM we have two types of access, one is AWS console access and other option is AWs programatic access.
you have to choose which one you want it.
