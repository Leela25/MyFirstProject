Important Points about Command Definition:
   - Nagios comes with in build Scripts/plugins
   - We can build custom scripts/plugins also according to our requirement
   - Once you add/update anything on Nagios configurations, to reflect that changes we need to restart the nagios

Example - check_process.sh
#!/bin/bash

pgrep $1 > /dev/null

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "$1 is Running, Everything looks good"
  exit 0

  echo "$1 is not Running, It's is in CRITICAL State"
  exit 2
fi


How to monitor Remote Machines:
    - We can monitor remote machines by connecting through ssh
    - ssh connection and command execution happens with "nagios" user
    - make sure nagios user having command "bash"
    - To check above point you need to go to "/etc/passwd"  file
    - "usermod -s /bin/bash nagios"
    - Generate ssh key pair
    - Add public key in remote server "authorized_keys" file
    - Now you can able to connect remote machine without password
    - ssh -i $privatekey ubuntu@$HOSTIP
    
Sample script to check a process on Remote machine:

#!bin/bash

PROCESS=$1
HOSTADDRESS=$2

ssh -i ubuntu@$HOSTADDRESS "pgrep $PROCESS"  > /dev/bash
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "$PROCESS is Running, Everything looks good"
  exit 0
else
  echo "$PROCESS is not Running, It's is in CRITICAL State"
  exit 2
fi
