S3(Simple Storage Service)
--------------------------
- To store some files, images etc.. we can use S3 in AWS
- in S3, we have buckets, we can create each bucket in different regions
- To access the bucket which u created by you, u need to grant the access to others(users/groups)
- To make your bucket to access by everyone, put the permissions as "Public"
- By default AWS, you can create 100 buckets max

- Bucket name should be unique across global(like DNS name)
